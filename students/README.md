```sql
CREATE TABLE `class_enrollments` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `class_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `student_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `join_date` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `status` enum('enrolled','dropped','completed') DEFAULT 'enrolled',
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `updated_at` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `unique_enrollment` (`class_id`, `student_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`class_id`) REFERENCES `teacher_classes` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`student_id`) REFERENCES `students` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
